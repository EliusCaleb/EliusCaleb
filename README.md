My experience
Project Salama
2023

Started in 2020 with an idea to create a new tracking device that was hard to locate and dismantle

Motorcycle theft and related crimes have been on the rise leading to loss of assets and lives. This was the genesis of the Salama Tracking Technologies. We exist to protect your assets.

We are creating custom tracking solutions for the Boda Boda Industry. Specializing in creating hardware devices running on custom software solutions.

I have developed the base architecture for the financial management system, as well as designed and tested different cards for the development team to implement.

Project Elewa
2022 - 2023

The Elewa "Conversational Learning Manager" is a Learning Management System (LMS) which allows organisations to design courses based on chat bots (through a visual editor).

I have developed the base architecture for the visual chatbot editor, as well as was instrumental in the design of the chatbot engine.
